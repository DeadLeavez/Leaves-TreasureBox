- zeroToHeroPouch replaces the alpha container with the waist pouch
- Override the minimum level to access the ragfair
- Adds the AK-105 compatible muzzles to the AK-12
- Changes name and description of the fake-ass vodka added by some stupid ass event. Can you tell I'm upset? I Can.
- Bot tier level adjustments
- Adds handguards from other AKs to the RPD, and allows muzzles from the AK103 on the RPD barrel
- Nerfs the spawn rate of gingy keychains from scavs
- Remvoes the rusted bloody key from fence.
- Adds the m203 to the usp. Deal with it.
- Reduce the trader refresh time.
